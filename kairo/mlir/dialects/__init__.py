"""Kairo Custom MLIR Dialects

This package contains custom MLIR dialect definitions for Kairo's
domain-specific operations.

Dialects:
- field: Field operations (gradients, diffusion, advection)
- agent: Agent-based modeling operations
- audio: Audio synthesis operations
- visual: Visual rendering operations

These dialects will be implemented progressively during v0.7.0 development.
